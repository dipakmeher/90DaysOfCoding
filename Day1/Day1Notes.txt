YT Code Babbar:
Lecture 1: Intro to Programming & Flowcharts

For any problem, do this 4 things:
>> Understand the problem properly
>> Find out the given values in the problem

>> Program: Code It...!

For this, we will first write 
Pseudocode/Flowchart(Rough Soln)==> Then write 
Source Code (Program)==> Then we will convert it into 
Machine Understandable format
